## Procedure document for the TDEP project - for course administrator and convenors

The Teaching Development and Enhancement Project (TDEP) Coding Resources Project aims to build a clear avenue where students and alumni and share their working code, coding best practices, the code from their thesis, or prior answers to formatives. This will take form of a GitHub repository whereby all on-course students are able to learn from those who came before them. 

This document hereby serves as a procedure document for course administrators and course convenors who hope to take part in the document. 

### Structure of the project

- An 'admin' repository, which contains admin files, including FAQ and license document of how and why the project is taking place, as well as instruction for user and maintanence team of the project.
- Repositories for courses and master theses, where those acutal working code and pass assignments from students and alumni goes into. Under every course repo there is a list of nested folder that are designed for each year's cohort. 
  - Prior to the setting up of those courses, verbal consent was collected from courses convenors.
