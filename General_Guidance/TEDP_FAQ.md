## TDEP Coding Resources - Frequently Asked Questions 




**What is TDEP Coding Resources?** 

Each year the question from students of “can I see past papers or code?” often arises. However, at present, no satisfactory answer to this question exists. To overcome this gap, the Teaching Development and Enhancement Project (TDEP) Coding Resources Project aims to build a clear avenue where students and alumni and share their working code, coding best practices, the code from their thesis, or prior answers to formatives. This will take form of a GitHub repository whereby all on-course students are able to learn from those who came before them 

 

**How do I benefit from partaking?** 

You may benefit in one of two ways. If you are an on-course student you will gain access to a rich archive of papers and code which has been submitted which may provide clarity on what is potentially expected from you. If you are an alum, you will be able to give back to the OII community and support the learning of current student, an often-rewarding experience! 

 

**Are there any** **IP** **risks involved with partaking?** 

Maybe. Given the vast number of licenses that are available we recognise that you may prefer a copy-left (e.g. GPL) or permissive (e.g. MIT) licence, or anything in-between. As such, it is your responsibility to choose a licence which you prefer and clearly state under which licence your work falls under on your documents. If you need guidance on choosing an appropriate licence, please visit https://choosealicense.com/ or alternatively email the TDEP Team who can advise further. 

 

**How do I indicate I want to join the TDEP Coding Resources project?** 

To partake in the TDEP project please complete this form <enter hyperlink>. By completing the form you consent to the collection and storage of your data, and that you have read the contractual agreement and this FAQ. Your personal data will be stored on Nexus365 and deleted after 5 years or if requested earlier. 

 

**Can I opt-out?** 

Yes. Should you decide later down the line that you want to remove your documents from the TDEP GitHub repository please email Linda Li ([linda.li@oii.ox.ac.uk](mailto:linda.li@oii.ox.ac.uk)). When doing so, please provide information surrounding the details of your documents so we can quickly identify them. 

 

**Are my documents anonymized?** 

Yes. However, it is your responsibility that you remove all identifiable information before submitting your papers and code. Should you rather remain identifiable then you are welcome to keep your name on your submitted documents. 

 

**How long will my data be kept?** 

Up to 5 years. In line with data retention laws, we believe that 5 years is a reasonable length of time to store your data. This will allow students on-course to view enough material to gather a good understanding of the type of work that has come before them, but also short enough that e.g. outdated languages or packages are removed from the archive. In the event you want your data to be stored less than 5 years please indicate this when completed your registration form. 

 

**Who can I contact if I have further questions?** 

In the first instance please contact coderesources@oii.ox.ac.uk.
