 

## TDEP Coding Resources – Memorandum of Understanding 

 This memorandum of understanding (“MoU”) is being made between a student, alumni or staff member of the Oxford Internet Institute (“participant”) and the TDEP Project organisers (“organisers”). 

 

**Background** **and Purpose** 

The TDEP Coding Resources Project (“the project”) aims to create a rich archive of summatives formatives, code, notes, other learning materials or any combination of these to primarily support on-course students in their academic and professional development. The purpose of this MoU is to provide further clarification regarding the obligations and expectations of both the participant and organizer within the context of the project. 

 

**Data Storage** **and** **Licensing** 

The participant’s submitted documents will be stored on GitHub. It is the responsibility of the participant to read, understand and agree with GitHub Data Protection and Privacy Policies, especially regarding data storage. It is the responsibility of the organizers to ensure the TDEP GitHub account is properly managed, including the use of reasonable password protection. The participant agrees that they would not hold the organizers liable for any data leakage due to forces outside the control of the organizers or due to unintentional negligence and any associated costs associated with any leak. To minimize any potential costs associated with a leak or otherwise, the participant agrees to anonymize their data, or otherwise, has given reasonable thought to keeping their documents identifiable and understand any associated consequences thereof. 

 

**Duration** 

This MoU will remain valid until the 5 years since the submission of documents by the participant has lapsed at which point the submitted document will also be removed from the TDEP GitHub repository. In the event the participant requests of their data to be removed before 5 years has lapsed, the MoU will no longer be in effect and data removed from GitHub in a timely fashion. 

 

**Further Administrative Matters** 

The participant understands that their OII email address will expires shortly after the submission of final summative work. This entails that in the event they access GitHub via their OII email address their access may be disrupted upon thesis completion. In the event they wish to access the TDEP GitHub archive after their graduation, it is the responsibility of the participant to ensure they either sign up to GitHub using their personal email address or change it before their OII account expires. The participant knows who the project’s main points of contact are and how to reach them. Upon submitting documents to support and contribute to the project, the participant confirms they have read both the MoU, FAQ, and have had the possibility to ask any the organisers any further questions they may have had.
