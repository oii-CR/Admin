## Workflow of adding students to the OII-CR repository

#### Steps for alumni and cohort that do not normally use GitHub

- Collect GitHub username from alumnus. This may include: from the OII-CR form upload form, survey, email etc. 
- Access the OII-CR organization. Go to ‘people’. Click ‘invite member’ and input username(e.g. lindali97). 
- In the following options, select role as ‘member’ in ‘Role in Organization’ - or ‘owner’ if they are supposed to be part of the maintanence team. Select the team ‘oii-SDS’ in ‘Teams’.

Please note that at the moment, all alumni could only be invited manually via the procedure. However, starting from MT 2021, we do hope to integrate Cavanas with GitHub classroom so that people can be invited automatically. 

#### Steps for current students (e.g. 2021-22 SDS cohort)

We suppose that for some pilot courses e.g. Fundamentals of Python for SDS, we use GitHub classroom for teaching & grading. Therefore, the process of adding students are as follows:

- In mid-September or early October, student names were added to Canvas.

- Create a new GitHub classroom linked to a GitHub organization of a course: please see the guidance [here](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/manage-classrooms).

- Add students to the GitHub classroom -  we may automatically fill in student name from Canvas roster, and when students sign into GitHub classroom with their own GitHub account, their name will be automatically linked with their GitHub account. This automatically gives them access to OII-CR. For this part, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/connect-a-learning-management-system-to-github-classroom) for more detailed guidance.

- Create a new GitHub team for all members of the organization. 

- Grant the team access to OII-CR (to be automated with a script via the GitHub REST API)
